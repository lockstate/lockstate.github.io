    <a href="/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      LockState, Inc. ("LockState") provides this "Privacy Policy" to inform our
      users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and
      disclosure of the personal information that we receive when they visit and
      use the <a href="https://www.remotelock.com">www.remotelock.com</a> site,
      the Connect portal and any websites owned or operated by LockState ( the
      "Site" or collectively, the "Sites"), and when they use any of LockState's
      products, services or applications (such as our mobile application). For
      ease of reading in this Privacy Policy, the Sites, products, services and
      applications are referred to collectively as the "Service" or "Services."
      This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us when
      you use the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your use of our Service indicates your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If
      you do not agree to any part of this Privacy Policy, then you should stop
      accessing the Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Changes to Privacy Policy</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to
      our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify
      you by email or other messaging systems (sent to the address specified in
      your account), otherwise through the Service (by a notice when you log in),
      or by means of posting an updated version of this Privacy Policy on the
      Site. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest
      information on our privacy practices. Any modifications to this Privacy
      Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon
      implementation of the new changes on the Service. In all of the above
      cases, your continued use of the Service after any notice or posted
      modified Privacy Policy indicates acceptance of the modified Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Collection of Personally Identifying Information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We receive information about you from various sources, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you create an account with us
      </li>
      <li>
        Your use of the Services generally
      </li>
      <li>
        Third party websites and services, such as any integrated service
        providers
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Account and Setup Information:</b>
      When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be PII
      or that could otherwise identify you or your location. The exact categories
      of information you provide can vary but almost all Accounts will generally
      require you to provide the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Name
      </li>
      <li>
        Address
      </li>
      <li>
        Password
      </li>
      <li>
        Email address
      </li>
      <li>
        Phone number
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used to provide you with the Services, and may be
      shared with other users or our business partners to provide you with the
      Services. For example, if you are granting access to a shared Account
      Member, some of your Account profile information, such as your name and the
      address of the Hardware's location, may be shared with the Member so that
      the Member can correctly identify the location to which you are granting
      them access.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Guest User Information:</b>
      Guests can use a Guest Code to access a lock or location without
      registering for an Account. An Account Member granting access to a Guest
      may enter information about the Guest, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Name
      </li>
      <li>
        Phone number
      </li>
      <li>
        Email address
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By using the Services in any manner, a Guest User hereby expressly consents
      to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of their information, which
      may include PII, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you are a Guest
      and do not consent to any of the foregoing, you must not use or access the
      Services, including any Hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are an Account Member or Owner, please ensure that you have a
      Guest's consent to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of their
      information in accordance with this Privacy Policy before (i) providing
      such information to the Services or (ii) inviting such Guest to use the
      Services, including by granting them access through a Guest Code. By
      inviting a Guest to use the Services or providing a Guest with a Guest Code
      through the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary
      consent to share such Guest's information, including their PII, with
      LockState for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Device and Application Information:</b>
      We may collect some Device-specific information when the service is used
      (e.g. when it unlocks or syncs with athe LockState cloud service). Device
      information may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unique device identifiers
      </li>
      <li>
        Network information
      </li>
      <li>
        Battery level
      </li>
      <li>
        Information about the ways in which the Device interacts with our
        services
      </li>
      <li>
        Device status
      </li>
      <li>
        Access logs
      </li>
      <li>
        Frequency of use of internal and external services
      </li>
      <li>
        Frequency of Guest Code creation and use
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use this information to operate, monitor, maintain and improve the
      Services, and to allow you to operate, monitor and maintain your Account
      and your Hardware (if applicable).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Purchase Information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you pre-order or purchase LockState products from our Site, we request
      that you provide your name, email address, billing and shipping address,
      credit card information and any other information necessary to complete the
      transaction. Your name, email address, billing and shipping address and the
      last four digits of your credit card information will be stored. Our credit
      card processing service provider will encrypt and store full payment card
      information from you when an order is placed.
    </p>

        Additional details about where LockState collects and uses PII.
        Website Visitors
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many websites, we collect certain information through the use of
      "cookies," which are small text files that are saved by your browser when
      you access our Services. We (and our third-party analytics providers, such
      as Google Analytics) may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to
      identify that you've logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when
      you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor
      aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize
      and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are
      deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although
      most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser
      options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before
      accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don't accept cookies,
      you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may employ and/or our third party tracking utility company may employ
      software technology called pixels (a.k.a. 1x1 clear images, beacons), that
      help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is
      effective. These pixels (or other tracking technology) may be included in
      or associated with e-mails or other communications that you receive from us
      (or our partners) in order to help us track your response and interests and
      to deliver you relevant content and services. We may tie information
      gathered by pixels or other tracking technology to PII.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>How We Use Personally Identifying Information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      PII is used for the following purposes: (i) to provide, administer and
      improve our Services, (ii) to better understand your needs and interests,
      (iii) to fulfill requests you may make, (iv) to personalize your
      experience, (v) to provide Service announcements, (vi) to provide you with
      further information and offers from LockState or third parties; (vii) to
      administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional
      activities or events sponsored or managed by LockState or our business
      partners; (viii) to facilitate the work of our partners involved in
      providing the Services to you; and (ix) to comply with our legal
      obligations, resolve disputes with users, enforce our agreements and to
      protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized or
      illegal activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Behavioral Targeting / Re-targeting</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising
      on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network
      partner may use cookies and pixels to collect non-personally identifiable
      information about your activities on our Site and other Web sites to
      provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to
      not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads,
      you may opt-out by clicking
      <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/">Here</a>. Please note this does
      not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive
      generic ads.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Information Related to the Use of the Services</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person
      uses our Services (we refer to this information as "Log Data"), including
      both account holders and non-account holders. Log Data may include
      information such as a user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, location,
      device and browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our
      Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or
      features, frequency with which the Services are used by a user, search
      terms, the features and links on our Services that a user clicked on or
      used, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the
      Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this
      information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features
      and functionality and tailoring them to our users' needs and preferences.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Support</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
      feedback mechanisms), we may use your information to contact you and
      provide support or a response. We also reserve the right to publish your
      request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
      us support other users.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Testimonials</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our Site in
      addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your
      testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your
      testimonial, you can contact us by emailing
      <a href="support@lockstate.com">support@lockstate.com</a>. If you provide
      us with comments or feedback we may collect your name and e-mail address,
      as well as any other content included in the e-mail to send you a reply and
      improve our Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Social Media Widgets</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Site and Services may include social media features, such as the
      Facebook "like" button and widgets, such as the "share this" button. These
      features may collect your PII and track your use of the Services. These
      social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly
      on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the
      Privacy Policy of the company providing such functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mailing List and Contact Information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may choose to submit your email address or other contact information
      via our Services. We may use this information to send you news about
      LockState-related services, products or promotions. We may use one or more
      service providers to administer these messages, but, except as described in
      "Disclosure to Third Parties," we do not share your email address with
      spammers or any other third parties without your permission. We will give
      you the ability to opt out of marketing-related e-mails by logging in and
      changing your account settings or by clicking on a link in each such
      e-mail. In some of our communications, we use tracking means, such as a
      "click-through URL" linked to content on the Site. We track this data to
      help us measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Aggregate and non-PII Information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      LockState may collect and analyze non-PII information about the performance
      of its Services. From time to time, LockState may disclose and use
      aggregate and non-personally-identifying information for industry analysis,
      demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business
      purposes, e.g., by reporting on trends in the usage of its devices, Sites
      or Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Disclosure to Third Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        We do not share or sell the Personal Identifying Information that you
        provide us with other organizations without your express consent. Under
        this Privacy Policy you and your guests hereby consent to sharing under
        the following circumstances:
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Our Service Providers.</i></b>
      We may employ third party companies and individuals to administer and
      provide the Services on our behalf, (including, without limitation, bill
      and credit card payment processing, maintenance, administration, support,
      hosting and database management services). These third parties may have
      access to your PII only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
      obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Your Third Party Services.</i></b>
      If you access our Service through a third-party (e.g. by managing your
      LockState device via your television remote or connecting your LockState
      device or Service to your home security system), or otherwise use a third
      party service provider in connection with the Service, or request or
      authorize us to give access or data to a third-party service provider (e.g.
      a delivery service, property management or rental service, or other service
      that you may use) we may provide PII (about you and your guests) and other
      information about the Service, the LockState device and their usage to such
      third-parties. You should only use trusted service providers, and give your
      authorization and information to trusted recipients. We encourage you to
      read the privacy policies and service terms of the third-party services
      that you use, as their privacy policies and terms govern their usage of the
      information that you provide them. While we make reasonable efforts to
      protect your information while it is under our control, we have no
      obligation with respect to the functionality of such third-party services
      or the use of such information under control of these third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Information Shared with Other Users.</i></b>
      If you invite a guest to access your device, then we may share certain
      elements of your information with them (name, lock location, picture, etc.)
      in order for them to understand the invite and access the device. We may
      also similarly share their information with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        <i>
          Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement; Protection of Rights and
          Safety.
        </i>
      </b>
      LockState cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and
      private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will use, and
      disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement
      officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
      necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including
      but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of
      LockState or a third party, to enforce our Terms of Service, End User
      License Agreement, and this Privacy Policy, to protect the safety of the
      public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to
      be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or
      legally actionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Business Transfers, Affiliates and Joint Ventures.</i></b>
      LockState may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets,
      including your PII, in connection with a merger, acquisition,
      reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. We may
      share your personal information with our parent company, subsidiaries,
      joint ventures, or other companies under a common control that we may have
      now or in the future, in which case we will require them to honor this
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Minors</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly
      collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII
      of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our
      files as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Changing or Deleting Your Information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      All LockState users may review, update, correct or delete the PII in their
      registration profile by logging into their account and changing the "user
      profile" information associated with their account. Removing your
      information may limit our ability to provide the Services to you. If you
      completely delete all such information, your account will be deactivated
      and you may lose access to the Service and your use of the device. You may
      also contact us at
      <a href="support@lockstate.com">support@lockstate.com</a> if you have
      additional questions or concerns. We'll take steps to modify or delete your
      information as soon as is practical, but some information may remain in
      archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Links to Other Sites and Services</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Services may contain links to other websites or services. The fact that
      we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or
      representation that we are affiliated with that third party. We do not
      exercise control over third party websites or services. Other websites and
      services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the PII
      you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or
      statements of the other websites you visit and services that you use.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Data Retention</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for
      legitimate business purposes. LockState will retain PII for as long as
      needed to provide you Services, subject to this Privacy Policy. LockState
      may retain and use this PII as necessary to comply with our legal
      obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Security</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow
      generally-accepted industry standards to protect the PII submitted to us,
      both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of
      transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
      secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>International Transfer</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        IMPORTANT: When you use the Service, your data may be sent to the United
        States and possibly other countries
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your information may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers
      located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental
      jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in
      your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose
      to provide information to LockState, please be advised that we transfer PII
      to the United States and process it there (and possibly other countries).
      Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such
      information represents your agreement to that transfer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect
      and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing
      so under applicable EU laws.  The legal bases depend on the Services you
      use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information
      only where:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the
        Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to
        protect the safety and security of the Services;
      </li>
      <li>
        It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data
        protection interests), such as for research and development, to market
        and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;
      </li>
      <li>
        You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
      </li>
      <li>
        We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific
      purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will
      not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using
      your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a
      legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use
      though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.
