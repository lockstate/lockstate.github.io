    trade secrets, moral rights and other intellectual and industrial property
    rights, and Customer hereby assigns to LockState any interest it may have
    in the same. Subject to the licenses granted under this Agreement,
    LockState expressly reserves all right, title and interest in and to all
    compilations, selections, arrangements, portions, extracts, adaptations,
    and derivatives of the Service and the Software (including all fixes and
    updates thereto).
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>7. Consequential Damages/Limitation of Liability.</b>
    EACH PARTY AGREES THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL LOCKSTATE OR ITS LICENSORS OR
    SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY,
    PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
    THE SERVICE, THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ANY INFORMATION OR OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED
    IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST DATA,
    PROPERTY DAMAGE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, AND/OR ANY INFORMATION OR

    LOCKSTATE' AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
    TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00). THE
    LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF
    ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>8. Term/Termination.</b>
    This Agreement shall commence on the date the Customer installs the
    Software and/or registers to use the Service (the "Effective Date") and
    shall continue for any applicable period for which Customer has paid for a
    Service subscription, unless otherwise terminated pursuant to this Section
    8 ("Term/Termination"). This Agreement will terminate automatically and
    without notice to Customer upon Customer's material breach of any term or
    condition of this Agreement. LockState reserves the right to discontinue
    the Service at any time with ninety (90) days notice to Customer, provided
    that LockState will refund the unused portion of any subscription fees paid
    by Customer applicable to the remaining portion of the then-current Service
    subscription. If the Service is provided on a no-charge basis to Customer,
    LockState may terminate this Agreement and Customer's access to the Service
    if Customer's account remains inactive for a period of ninety (90) days or
    more and Customer does not use Customer's account after LockState has
    provided notice by email of such inactivity. Promptly upon termination or
    expiration of this Agreement, Customer will: (i) cease use of the Service
    and the Software; and (ii) destroy all copies of the Software, and certify
    such destruction in writing to LockState. The foregoing requirement applies
    to all copies in any form, partial or complete, including copies in storage
    media and regardless if any copy is merged into other materials. Sections 4
    ("Customer Warranty"), 5 ("Warranty Disclaimer"), 6 ("Ownership"), 7
    ("Consequential Damages/Limitation of Liability"), 8 ("Term/Termination"),
    and 10 ("General") shall survive any termination of this Agreement. ON
    EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DATA CUSTOMER HAS STORED
    ON THE SERVICE MAY NOT BE RETRIEVED, AND LockState SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION
    TO MAINTAIN ANY DATA STORED IN CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT OR TO FORWARD ANY DATA TO
    CUSTOMER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY. Customer agrees that LockState may retain
    (but shall have no obligation to retain) Customer's data for a period after
    Customer's account has been terminated, expired, or otherwise lapsed, as
    part of LockState marketing to Customer of the opportunity to purchase,
    renew, or extend Customer's account.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>9. Fees.</b>
    If applicable, Customer expressly agrees that LockState (or if applicable,
    a thermostat manufacturer or other service operator) is permitted to bill
    Customer the fees, any applicable tax and any other charges Customer may
    incur in connection with Customer's use of the Service and/or Software in
    accordance with the payment page. LockState reserves the right to change
    the fees at any time which will be reflect on the payment page and will be
    effective thirty (30) days after notice of the change. Customer must
    provide LockState (or, if applicable, the thermostat manufacturer or
    service operator) with a valid credit card. If timely payment is not
    received or cannot be charged to Customer's credit card for any reason,
    LockState reserves the right to either suspend or terminate Customer's
    access to the Services and/or the Software. By using the Service, Customer
    consents to receiving electronic communications from LockState. These
    electronic communications may include notices about applicable fees and
    charges, transactional information and other information concerning or
    related to the Services. These electronic communications are part of
    Customer's relationship with LockState and Customer receives them as part
    of Customer's agreement with LockState. Customer agrees that any notices,
    agreements, disclosures or other communications that LockState sends to
    Customer electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements,
    including that such communications be in writing. LOCKSTATE MAY, IN ITS
    SOLE DISCRETION AND FROM TIME TO TIME, ESTABLISH OR AMEND GENERAL OPERATING
    PRACTICES TO MAXIMIZE THE OPERATION AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICE AND TO
    PREVENT ABUSES. IN THE EVENT CUSTOMER IS DEEMED TO HAVE VIOLATED THIS
    POLICY, LOCKSTATE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE PRICING PLAN
    OR SERVICE THAT WILL PERMIT CUSTOMER TO CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE.
    ALTHOUGH VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY HAVE BEEN INFREQUENT, WE RESERVE THE
    RIGHT TO TERMINATE OR SUSPEND CUSTOMER'S RIGHT TO USE THE SERVICE, WITHOUT
    PRIOR NOTICE IN THE EVENT OF A VIOLATION OF THIS POLICY.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>10. General.</b>
    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
    laws of the State of Colorado, excluding its conflict of law provisions.
    Customer and LockState agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
    federal and state courts of the State of Colorado. This Agreement shall be
    governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Colorado, without
    regard to its conflict of law rules. The parties agree that the Uniform
    Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) is hereby excluded from
    application to this Agreement and the parties agree that the United Nations
    Convention for the International Sale of Goods is excluded in its entirety
    from this Agreement. No waiver, amendment or modification of any provision
    of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the
    party against whom such waiver, amendment or modification is sought to be
    enforced. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right,
    power or remedy under this Agreement, except as specifically provided
    herein, shall be deemed as a waiver of any such right, power or remedy.
    Either party may assign this Agreement to an entity acquiring substantially
    all of its assets or merging with it, provided that such assignee agrees in
    writing to assume all obligations under this Agreement and a copy of such
    writing is provided to the other party hereunder. Except as set forth
    above, neither party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
    obligations under this Agreement to any party without the express written
    consent of the other party. Any attempted assignment in violation of the
    foregoing shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the above, this
    Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors
    and assigns of the parties hereto. Customer acknowledges that the Software
    contains trade secrets, the disclosure of which would cause substantial
    harm to LockState that could not be remedied by the payment of damages
    alone. Accordingly, LockState will be entitled to preliminary and permanent
    injunctive relief and other equitable relief against Customer for any
    breach of the terms of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement
    shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law,
    the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
    effect. Customer shall not export the Software in violation of any export
    control laws. Any notice, consent or other communication hereunder shall be
    in writing, and shall be given personally, by certified mail or by express
    delivery to either party at their respective addresses, for Customer the
    address set forth in the registration or download form and for LockState as
    set forth on LockState' website or such other address as may be designated
    by written notice of either party. Notices shall be deemed given when
    delivered or transmitted, or seven (7) days after deposit in the mail. The
    parties' relationship shall be solely that of independent contractor and
    nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to make either party
    an agent, partner, joint venturer or representative of the other for any
    purpose. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement
    between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
    supersedes all prior and contemporaneous proposals, negotiations,
    agreements and all other communications between the parties with respect to
    the subject matter hereof.
