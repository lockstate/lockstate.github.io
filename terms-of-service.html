  <p>
    <b>8. Term/Termination.</b>
    This Agreement shall commence on the date the Customer installs the
    Software and/or registers to use the Service (the "Effective Date") and
    shall continue for any applicable period for which Customer has paid for a
    Service subscription, unless otherwise terminated pursuant to this Section
    8 ("Term/Termination"). This Agreement will terminate automatically and
    without notice to Customer upon Customer's material breach of any term or
    condition of this Agreement. LockState reserves the right to discontinue
    the Service at any time with ninety (90) days notice to Customer, provided
    that LockState will refund the unused portion of any subscription fees paid
    by Customer applicable to the remaining portion of the then-current Service
    subscription. If the Service is provided on a no-charge basis to Customer,
    LockState may terminate this Agreement and Customer's access to the Service
    if Customer's account remains inactive for a period of ninety (90) days or
    more and Customer does not use Customer's account after LockState has
    provided notice by email of such inactivity. Promptly upon termination or
    expiration of this Agreement, Customer will: (i) cease use of the Service
    and the Software. The foregoing requirement applies to all copies in any form,
    partial or complete, including copies in storage media and regardless if any copy
    is merged into other materials. Sections 4 ("Customer Warranty"), 5 ("Warranty
    Disclaimer"), 6 ("Ownership"), 7 ("Consequential Damages/Limitation of
    Liability"), 8 ("Term/Termination"), and 10 ("General") shall survive
    any termination of this Agreement. ON EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THIS
    AGREEMENT, ANY DATA CUSTOMER HAS STORED ON THE SERVICE MAY NOT BE
    RETRIEVED, AND LOCKSTATE SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN ANY DATA
    STORED IN CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT OR TO FORWARD ANY DATA TO CUSTOMER OR TO
    ANY THIRD PARTY. Customer agrees that LockState may retain (but shall
    have no obligation to retain) Customer's data for a period after
    Customer's account has been terminated, expired, or otherwise lapsed, as
    part of LockState marketing to Customer of the opportunity to purchase,
    renew, or extend Customer's account.
  </p>

  <div>
    <b>9. Fees.</b>

    <p>
      9.1  Generally.  If applicable, Customer expressly agrees that LockState
      (or if applicable, a thermostat manufacturer or other service operator)
      is permitted to bill Customer the fees, any applicable tax and any other
      charges Customer may incur in connection with Customer's use of the
      Service and/or Software in accordance with the payment page. If you
      connect the Service to any utility provider, thermostat manufacturer, or
      other service operator, you represent and warrant that: (a) you have all
      rights necessary to connect to such utility provider, thermostat
      manufacturer, or other service operator; and (b) you will be responsible
      with all associated fees and charges.
    </p>

    <p>
      9.2 Subscription. Once you sign up for a subscription to the Service,
       You agree and acknowledge that your credit card on file will
      automatically be charged for each renewal (whether annual or monthly)
      without any action on your part until cancelled as outlined herein. If
      you wish to cancel the Services,  you must cancel your account in your
      account dashboard prior to the next billing period.  There are no
      refunds for accounts cancelled part way through a billing cycle.  Except
      as permitted herein, all subscriptions are non-cancellable and
      non-refundable.  LockState reserves the right to change the fees at any
      time which will be reflect on the payment page and will be effective
      thirty (30) days after notice of the change. Customer must provide
      LockState (or, if applicable, the thermostat manufacturer or service
      operator) with a valid credit card and must update it with any changes.
      If timely payment is not received or cannot be charged to Customer's
      credit card for any reason, LockState reserves the right to either
      suspend or terminate Customer's access to the Services and/or the
      Software.
    </p>

    <p>
      9.3 Electronic Communications; Modifications.  By using the Service,
      Customer consents to receiving electronic communications from LockState.
      These electronic communications may include notices about applicable
      fees and charges, transactional information and other information
      concerning or related to the Services. These electronic communications
      are part of Customer's relationship with LockState and Customer receives
      them as part of Customer's agreement with LockState. Customer agrees
      that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that
      LockState sends to Customer electronically will satisfy any legal
      communication requirements, including that such communications be in
      writing. LOCKSTATE MAY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AND FROM TIME TO TIME,
      ESTABLISH OR AMEND GENERAL OPERATING PRACTICES TO MAXIMIZE THE OPERATION
      AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICE AND TO PREVENT ABUSES. IN THE EVENT CUSTOMER
      IS DEEMED TO HAVE VIOLATED THIS POLICY, LOCKSTATE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO
      OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE PRICING PLAN OR SERVICE THAT WILL PERMIT CUSTOMER
      TO CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE. ALTHOUGH VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY HAVE
      BEEN INFREQUENT, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OR SUSPEND CUSTOMER'S
      RIGHT TO USE THE SERVICE, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE IN THE EVENT OF A
      VIOLATION OF THIS POLICY.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    <b>10. General.</b>
    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
    laws of the State of Colorado, excluding its conflict of law provisions.
    Customer and LockState agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
    federal and state courts of the State of Colorado. This Agreement shall be
    governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Colorado, without
    regard to its conflict of law rules. The parties agree that the Uniform
    Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) is hereby excluded from
    application to this Agreement and the parties agree that the United Nations
    Convention for the International Sale of Goods is excluded in its entirety
    from this Agreement. No waiver, amendment or modification of any provision
    of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the
    party against whom such waiver, amendment or modification is sought to be
    enforced. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right,
    power or remedy under this Agreement, except as specifically provided
    herein, shall be deemed as a waiver of any such right, power or remedy.
    Either party may assign this Agreement to an entity acquiring substantially
    all of its assets or merging with it, provided that such assignee agrees in
    writing to assume all obligations under this Agreement and a copy of such
    writing is provided to the other party hereunder. Except as set forth
    above, neither party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
    obligations under this Agreement to any party without the express written
    consent of the other party. Any attempted assignment in violation of the
    foregoing shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the above, this
    Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors
    and assigns of the parties hereto. Customer acknowledges that the Software
    contains trade secrets, the disclosure of which would cause substantial
    harm to LockState that could not be remedied by the payment of damages
    alone. Accordingly, LockState will be entitled to preliminary and permanent
    injunctive relief and other equitable relief against Customer for any
    breach of the terms of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement
    shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law,
    the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
    effect. Customer shall not export the Software in violation of any export
    control laws. Any notice, consent or other communication hereunder shall be
    in writing, and shall be given personally, by certified mail or by express
    delivery to either party at their respective addresses, for Customer the
    address set forth in the registration or download form and for LockState as
    set forth on LockState' website or such other address as may be designated
    by written notice of either party. Notices shall be deemed given when
    delivered or transmitted, or seven (7) days after deposit in the mail. The
    parties' relationship shall be solely that of independent contractor and
    nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to make either party
    an agent, partner, joint venturer or representative of the other for any
    purpose. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement
    between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
    supersedes all prior and contemporaneous proposals, negotiations,
    agreements and all other communications between the parties with respect to
    the subject matter hereof.
